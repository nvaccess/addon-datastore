## Features

* 24-hour or narrated 12-hour format (early morning / morning / afternoon / night).
* Optional **abbreviated** 12-hour style (e.g., “five twelve in the afternoon”).
* “Half past” at :30.
* Greetings (“good morning”, “good afternoon”, “good evening/night”).
* Hourly and half-hour **chimes** before automatic announcements.
* **Quiet hours** (do-not-disturb) with configurable start/end times.
* Default hotkey: **Ctrl+Shift+V**.

## Settings

NVDA → Preferences → Settings → **Voz do Tempo**  
Options include greetings, 24h/12h, abbreviated style (12h), say “half past”, chime before automatic announcements, announce frequency (hourly or half-hourly), and quiet hours.

## Changelog

* **1.0.10**
  * Fix: automatic announcements no longer trigger early at :59. Now fires exactly at minute 00 (and 00/30 if configured), with ~2s tolerance and debounce.
* **1.0.9**
  * Grammar: in 24-hour mode, 00:00–00:59 now says “**é zero hora …**” (singular).
