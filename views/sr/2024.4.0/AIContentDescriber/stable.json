See add-on documentation for more information on this.\nThen, choose the \"AI content describer\" category from NVDA's settings dialog -> manage models and enter your API key.\nPress NVDA+shift+i to pop up a menu asking how you wish to describe based on the current position, or NVDA+shift+u to describe the navigator object, or NVDA+shift+y for an image that has been copied to the clipboard such as in windows explorer. Other keystrokes are customizable from the input gestures dialog.", "sha256": "c6fa79fb1376659997258569941d34253f14ac9b148b8e2562847c9153a96fc9", "addonVersionName": "2024.05.22", "addonVersionNumber": {"major": 2024, "minor": 5, "patch": 22}, "minNVDAVersion": {"major": 2023, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "lastTestedVersion": {"major": 2024, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "channel": "stable", "publisher": "Carter Temm and contributors", "sourceURL": "https://github.com/cartertemm/AI-content-describer/", "license": "GPL v2", "licenseURL": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "reviewUrl": "https://github.com/nvaccess/addon-datastore/discussions/2048"}
