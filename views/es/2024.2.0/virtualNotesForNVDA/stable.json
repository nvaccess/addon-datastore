Here are the available steps:  \n* Select text;  \n* Use shortcuts (all starting with the keys \"NVDA + Alt\").  \nBy pressing these keys combined with specific letters, you can perform the following actions:\n* A: Add a new temporary note to memory;  \n* J: Go to the previous note;  \n* L: Go to the next note;  \n* U: Read out the current note;  \n* S: Replace the note in the current position (you need to select some text first);  \n* D: Delete the note in the current position.  \nIf the current note contains multiple lines (like text copied from a text editor), use these additional letters:  \n* I: Move to the previous line of the current note;  \n* K: Move to the next line of the current note;  \n* O: read out the current line of the current note.  \nNote: The key positions mimic the arrow keys (I = up, L = right, K = down, and J = left).  \nAfter using a shortcut, a specific sound will play to indicate the action performed.\n\n", "sha256": "7b64a3c5af03c10c3d74918f870836d13e178def725d0a852ab00f161406296b", "addonVersionName": "1.1.0", "addonVersionNumber": {"major": 1, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "minNVDAVersion": {"major": 2019, "minor": 3, "patch": 0}, "lastTestedVersion": {"major": 2024, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "channel": "stable", "publisher": "Juliano Lopes", "sourceURL": "https://github.com/juliano-lopes/virtual-notes-for-NVDA/", "license": "GPL v2", "homepage": "https://github.com/juliano-lopes/virtual-notes-for-NVDA", "licenseURL": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "reviewUrl": "https://github.com/nvaccess/addon-datastore/discussions/3366"}
