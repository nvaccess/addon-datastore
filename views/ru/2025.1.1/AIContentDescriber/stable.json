Other keystrokes are customizable from the input gestures dialog.\nBy default, usage of GPT4 is free, thanks to the generocity of the team at PollinationsAI.\nIf you would like to use other models from OpenAI, head to https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys and create an account, then create a key for interacting with the API.\nThen, choose the \"AI content describer\" category from NVDA's settings dialog -> manage models and enter your API key.\nThe process is similar for other model providers, see add-on documentation for more information on this.", "sha256": "9828fae0105ee763944979760d9f347a5d1efa99645ad999e91cb5cdc96d4d94", "addonVersionName": "2025.06.17", "addonVersionNumber": {"major": 2025, "minor": 6, "patch": 17}, "minNVDAVersion": {"major": 2023, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "lastTestedVersion": {"major": 2025, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "channel": "stable", "publisher": "Carter Temm, Carter Temm <cartertemm@gmail.com> and other contributors", "sourceURL": "https://github.com/cartertemm/AI-content-describer/", "license": "GPL v2", "licenseURL": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "submissionTime": 1750194945000, "reviewUrl": "https://github.com/nvaccess/addon-datastore/discussions/2048"}
