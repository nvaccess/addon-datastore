There will be a delay when performing these commands in Creator.\n* In Creator, Remote VT, and Track Tool, status bar content will be reported when performing read status bar command (NVDA+End/desktop layout, NVDA+Shift+End/laptop layout). In particular, improved status bar content announcement performance in Creator.\n* In Creator and Remote VT, NVDA will announce search results count when searching for tracks in insert tracks dialog.\n* In Creator and Remote VT, NVDA will no longer appear to do nothing or play error tones when reporting playlist information from playlist editor such as playlist hour and day, scheduled, and rotation.", "licenseURL": "https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html", "submissionTime": 1766450437000}
