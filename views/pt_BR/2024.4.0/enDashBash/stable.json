En dashes are used to connect symmetric items, such as the two ends of a range of numbers or dates; to contrast values or illustrate a relationship between two things (such as Mexican\u2013American War); to compound attributes, where one of the connected items is itself a compound (such as New York\u2013style pizza); and, when spaced, to set off parenthetical expressions \u2013 like this one \u2013 in the middle of sentences. In some languages, en dashes are sometimes used to indicate a change of speaker in quoted dialogue. Unspaced em dashes are used similarly to spaced en dashes to set off parenthetical expressions.\n\nBy default, NVDA+- types an en dash, and NVDA+Shift+- types an em dash. These commands can be changed in NVDA's input gestures dialog.", "sha256": "f0fdc862e120fb16ed508a626c5b0d5ce68cb576c64a33006cbe4a17a9715ab2", "addonVersionName": "1.0.0", "addonVersionNumber": {"major": 1, "minor": 0, "patch": 0}, "minNVDAVersion": {"major": 2024, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "lastTestedVersion": {"major": 2024, "minor": 1, "patch": 0}, "channel": "stable", "publisher": "Bill Dengler", "sourceURL": "https://github.com/codeofdusk/endashbash-nvda/", "license": "MIT", "homepage": "https://github.com/codeofdusk/endashbash-nvda", "licenseURL": "https://github.com/codeofdusk/endashbash-nvda/blob/master/COPYING.txt", "reviewUrl": "https://github.com/nvaccess/addon-datastore/discussions/4084"}
