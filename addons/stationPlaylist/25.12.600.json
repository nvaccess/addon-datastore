			"changelog": "* В настройках дополнения в разделе объявлений о состоянии добавлена настройка, позволяющая объявлять, когда корзина завершает воспроизведение (NVDA сообщит: `Корзина остановлена`).\n* В настройках/объявлениях о состоянии дополнения флажок имени корзины теперь является флажком списка объявлений о корзине, а прежний параметр становится доступным для отметки.\n* В Studio 6.20 и выше, панель управления SPL может использоваться для управления локальной и/или удаленной Studio. Новый параметр в диалоге настроек дополнения на панели дополнительных настроек позволяет настраивать покрытие/область действия панели управления SPL как между локальной Studio, так и с удаленной Studio, или между той или иной. В более ранних выпусках Studio уровень панели управления SPL будет управлять локальной Studio.\n* В локальной Studio при выполнении команд прошедшего времени дорожки (Alt+Shift+T) и Оставшегося времени (Control+Alt+T) также будет объявлено прошедшее и оставшееся время для воспроизводимой в данный момент голосовой дорожки и/или корзины. Кроме того, нажатие панели управления SPL, R объявит оставшуюся продолжительность воспроизводимой дорожки, голосовой дорожки или корзины для локальной студии.\n* Панели настроек потоковой передачи метаданных и объявлений о состоянии не будут отображаться при открытии экрана настроек дополнения из Удалённой Studio.\n* Настройки объявлений о сканированиях библиотеки и запросах слушателей не будут отображаться в настройках дополнения при открытии из Удалённой Studio.\n* В локальной Studio NVDA правильно объявит значение начала дорожки (помощник SPL, S).\n* В локальной Studio NVDA больше не будет объявлять неверную информацию при поиске различной информации на экране, например данные о погоде, если на экране отображается кнопка журнала ошибок.\n* Команда переключения объявления о сканировании библиотеки (NVDA+Shift+R) теперь доступна только в локальной Studio.\n* Изменены следующие команды раскладки JAWS помощника SPL: продолжительность часа (с H на T), оставшаяся продолжительность в часе (с Shift+H на H), сканирование библиотеки (с Shift+R на Alt+T), редактирование/вставка корзины (с T на числовая строка 0).\n* Устранено объявление и использование столбца запланированного времени/Времени в локальной Studio 6.20, включая объявления о неправильном содержимом столбца, когда для навигации по вертикальному столбцу установлено значение запланированного времени, сообщение NVDA \"Запланированное время не найдено\", когда этот столбец настроен как слот проводника столбцов, и неправильный заголовок столбца, отображаемый в расшифровках списка воспроизведения.\n* Решены проблемы с работой с результатами из диалога вставки дорожек в локальной Studio 6.20, включая сообщение NVDA \"Исполнитель не найден\" при выполнении команд проводника столбцов (Control+NVDA+цифра числового ряда) для получения информации об исполнителе, неправильная информация о столбце, объявляемая в проводнике столбцов, а также слышимость высоких и низких сигналов.\n* NVDA больше не будет включать пустое содержимое столбца при создании расшифровок списков воспроизведения в форматах обычного текста и списка HTML.\n* В локальной Studio NVDA больше не будет объявлять \"Дорожка не воспроизводится\" при объявлении названия следующей дорожки, когда дорожки не воспроизводятся, но название следующей дорожки отображается на экране.\n* В Удалённой Studio создание снимков списка воспроизведения (помощник SPL, F8) даёт более точные результаты.\n* В Удалённой Studio NVDA больше не будет ничего делать или воспроизводить сигналы ошибок при объявлении названий текущей и следующей дорожки при настройке на объявление информации о проигрывателе дорожек."
