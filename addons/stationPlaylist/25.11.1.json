	"changelog": "* Initial support for StationPlaylist suite 6.20.\n* Initial support for StationPlaylist Remote Studio. Although the interface resembles local Studio, not all commands and features are available.\n* While in cart explorer from Remote Studio, NVDA will announce cart name and its type such as local or Studio cart.\n* Additional internal changes to make the add-on more compatible with upcoming 64-bit NVDA. In particular, resolved erroneous announcements when performing some SPL Assistant layer commands in local (original) Studio.\n* In local Studio, NVDA will be more successful when entering Cart Explorer (Alt+NVDA+3) in more cases.\n* In local Studio, resolved a potential security and privacy issue after switching users while Cart Explorer is active where the cart assignments from the previous user can be announced."
